The reason behind that is, browsers have their safety and security regulations, and some websites provide pop-ups. Hence, the browsers avoid opening such sites using the pop-up blocker functionality which you later turn ON or OFF. So how do I do this? Simple, follow these steps for corresponding browsers.<p><b><br></b><p><b>Chrome:</b><p>Generally, when you open any web pages in the chrome, if there are any popups for that particular website, the chrome opens them in new tab but block them from displaying content. On top right of the address bar, you can see small cross icon being displayed.<p>On clicking that icon, you will see the options either to allow or block the popups from that URL. You can select the option to always allow the popups from that particular website, if you trust the source.<p>So from the next time, the Chrome remembers your settings for that website and always allow the pop-ups.<p><b><br></b><p><b>Mozilla Firefox:</b><p>Visit the below website to learn about how you can turn off the pop up blockers in Mozilla Firefox. With these simple steps you can open multiple URL‚Äôs at a time without any obstacles.<p><b>Link</b>: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting</a><p><b><br></b><p><b>Microsoft Edge:</b><p><b></b>If you are a fan of Microsoft Edge and your most part of time spent on Internet is through Microsoft Edge then, you can visit the below link which will help you to turn the pop up blocker off in few simple steps.<p><b></b><p><b>Link</b>: <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/how-manage-sites-allowed-serve-pop-ups-microsoft-edge#slide-0-field_images-57881\">http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/how-manage-sites-allowed-serve-pop-ups-microsoft-edge#slide-0-field_images-57881\</a><p><b><br></b><p><b>Internet Explorer:</b><p>If you are still a trust worthy user of Internet Explorer, then the below link will help you understand how to turn the pop up blocker in IE and use URLOpener.net more effectively.<p><b>Link:</b> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/17479/windows-internet-explorer-11-change-security-privacy-settings">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/17479/windows-internet-explorer-11-change-security-privacy-settings</a><p><b></b><p><b><br></b><p><b>Safari:</b><p><b>Link</b>: <a href="https://suffolk.screenstepslive.com/s/1050/m/popups/l/11616-how-do-i-enable-pop-ups-for-safari-4-or-higher-mac#!prettyPhoto">https://suffolk.screenstepslive.com/s/1050/m/popups/l/11616-how-do-i-enable-pop-ups-for-safari-4-or-higher-mac#!prettyPhoto</a></p>
